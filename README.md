# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends about what goals are most successful for theater campaigns
- We discovered that the most successful campaigns for theater projects in Great Britain have "Goals" set no higher than $2,000 since that is the upper amount most people were willing to pledge toward the campaign. 
- The most successful campaigns in the United States had average "Goals" set around $5,000. 
- Finally, the most successful campaings were launched around May/June.
